Game Instructions
Start the Game: When the game starts, the snake begins moving to the right by default.
Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the direction of the snake.
Eat Apples: The snake grows longer each time it eats an apple, and your score increases.
Avoid Collisions: Don't run into the walls or the snake's own body, or it's game over!
Example
The game window opens and you control a green snake on a black background. Apples appear as red circles, and your score is displayed at the top of the screen. The game continues until the snake collides with itself or the wall.

Important Notes
Screen Size: The game is set to a fixed screen size of 600x600 pixels. Each game unit is 25x25 pixels.
Speed: The game speed is controlled by a delay of 75 milliseconds between moves. You can adjust this by modifying the DELAY constant in the GamePanel class.
Customization: Feel free to modify the colors, speed, and size to make the game more challenging or visually appealing.
